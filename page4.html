<h1 align="center">BDUBS aka BWW aka Buffalo Wild Wings</h1>
<p> Thursday night wing night is my favorite day of the week. </p> 	
<p> I use to work at Best Buy in Bangor. On Thursdays after close, anywhere from 5 to 15 
of us would go over to Buffalo Wild Wings. It eventually became a weekly thing, making
me love wing night. Even though I have a new job, I still go from time to time since it
is such a good deal. I mean... Who doesn't love cheap wings?</p>
