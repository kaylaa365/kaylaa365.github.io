	<p> Hello! I am a second year student at UMaine. I grew up in Pembroke, New Hampshire, 
	and graduated from Pembroke Academy in 2015. In early 2016 I moved to Maine and decided 
	to attend UMaine. This past spring I joined greek life and became a sister of Phi Mu. 
	In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends and sisters, going to wing night at 
	BDUBS, and taking naps.</p>
